SI 206: Data Oriented Programming Project 4

For this project, I made a dodger style game using Pygame

The objective of this game is that you are a Diag squirrel that has woken up on by the Michigan Stadium and you must
find your way back to the Diag by dodging the Blue Busses while crossing the road. You use all four arrow keys to move, 
as you can only reach the Diag if you cross the road 3 times. You have 3 lives, but if you run into a Blue Bus you will lose 
a life. Game will end either when you successfully cross the road 3 times or if you run out of lives.

This game features 3 introduction screens, class inhertiance, horizontal and verticle player movement constrained to the width of the screen, background music, collision detection, collision detection noise, and a display of current lives which functions as "score".
